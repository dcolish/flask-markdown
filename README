Flask-Markdown

This is a small module to load markdown processing into
your flask.

To setup the development environment

  $ git clone https://github.com/dcolish/flask-markdown.git
  $ virtualenv ENV
  $ . ENV/bin/activate
  $ python setup.py develop

You should now be able to run the test suite with

  $ python setup.py test

!! There is a bug in the current release of 'nose' which results in 'NoneType'
   objects being called on test-suite shutdown. Please ignore this.

To setup the documentation environment

  $ pip install sphinx
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update
